# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI

Made in C - Created for school project
How to play:
1. Enter player name after running the code
2. Input the number corresponding to the position in the grid you want to select.
3. AI will make its move
4. Your turn - Continue until there is a winner or draw.

AI Functionality - Priority System:
It will scan every mark on the board, and make one of the following moves
1. If AI can win next turn - it will.
2. If AI can prevent the user from winning next turn (block the line of 3) - it will.
3. Random position

Future scope:
1. Include a system to decide who goes first - perhaps a coinflip type system, or I will just let user choose.
2. Change AI moveset, instead of making it random, I have some plans to implement a more sophisticated moveset.
